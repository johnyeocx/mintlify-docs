### Configuring the trigger request

In the Recase workflow builder, you can define a list of data points you want to send in the trigger request body. Each data point takes on a 'key' and 'type'. For instance, an appropriate HTTP request body corresponding to the config shown above is:

```json
{
    "risk_score": 0,
    "industry": "Gaming",
    "country": "United Kingdom",
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "monthly_tx_volume": 3000,
}
```

These data points can then be used in following steps of the workflow!



### Triggering the workflow
You can trigger the workflow by sending a POST request to the Recase API:

```bash Request
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.recaseai.com/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/run
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}' \
    --data '{
        "example_field": "Example field value"
    }'
    -- 
```

Here, the **workflow_id** is specified as a parameter in the URL string, and the data to send should match what you have configured in Recase.
