The `Outgoing Request` step is useful for fetching data from your internal backend, or sending event updates.

### Configuring the outgoing request step

**1. Request URL**

This is the request URL and method that will be executed during this step.

**2. Response Body**

This is the response body expected when making the request above:

To build your response body, specify a list of 'key' and 'type', for each data point returned. These can then be used in subsequent steps of the workflow.
