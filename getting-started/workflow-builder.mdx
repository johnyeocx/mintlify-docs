The workflow builder is where you will build your risk decisioning flow. The example below shows a sample Transaction Monitoring flow.

A workflow is made up of **steps**. In the image above, the steps are `Request`, `SEON`, `Score` and so on. Each step falls into one of the following categories:

### Trigger
This is what triggers a workflow and can be one of the following:

1. A HTTP request sent by your system
2. A CRON schedule
3. An event from an external data source (e.g. Stripe sending in disputes)

### Data sources
Data sources are used to enrich your decisioning process by allowing you to configure rules around more data points.

Recase allows you to easily connect and pull in risk data from external providers (e.g. SEON for fraud, ComplyAdvantage for KYC checks). You can use our no-code connectors to quickly pull in the data you want without dedicating engineering effort to interact with these data providers' APIs.

### Rules & Actions
These are the pre-built utility actions provided by Recase to give you the tools you need to design a comprehensive decisioning flow. The most common example would be:

1. Rules: You can use these to configure different paths for your workflow to take based on conditions on data
2. POST Request: You can use this send / retrieve data from your internal backend
3. Scoring: You can use this to easily assign a score to each case and update the score based on conditions on data

Other components include document creation (for STR, disputes, etc.), Live Form (for taking in manual inputs) and more.
