title: Case Management
---

Everytime a workflow runs, a **case** is created. Cases are organised per workflow. For each case, you'll be able to easily view each step that has run, and perform manual review / actions on that case.

Our case management system is focused on two goals:


1. Quick navigation and understanding of each case to boost your manual review efficiency
2. Easy visualisation of data to understand the performance of your workflow and iterate / optimise quickly


### Dashboard
This is where you can see all the cases that have run for that workflow. You can search, filter and configure which columns to show. Additionally, you can assign cases to members in your organisation

### Case View

This is where you can see the result of each step run for that case. Additionally, you can configure visualisations for your data points like graphs & charts.
